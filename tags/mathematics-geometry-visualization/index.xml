      <description>This summer I had the great oportunity to attend an give a talk at Pydata Berlin 2018. The topic of my talk was On Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction. During the Unsupervised Learning &amp;amp; Visualization session Dr. Stefan KÃ¼hn presented a very interesting and visual talk on Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization and Feature Engineering and Dr. Evelyn Trautmann gave a nice application of spectral clustering (here are some nice notes around this subject) in the context of Extracting relevant Metrics.</description>
