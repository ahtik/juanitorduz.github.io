      <description>In this post I want to present some notes around the fundamentals of the Hopf fibration \(\pi: S^3 \longrightarrow S^2\) which I started writing during my PhD period at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. First, I describe its definition and I show that it is a non-trivial map by computing its first Chern class. Then I give a detailed treatment of the construction of two important Dirac-type operators: the Hodge-de Rham and the spin-Dirac.</description>

      <description>In this post I present the results of my Mathematics PhD thesis which I wrote under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jochen Brüning at Humbolt Universität zu Berlin. I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Berlin Mathematical School and the research project SFB 647: Space - Time - Matter
Abstract:
John Lott has computed an integer-valued signature for the orbit space of a compact orientable \((4k+1)\) manifold with a semi-free \(S^1\)-action, which is a homotopy invariant of that space, but he did not construct a Dirac type operator which has this signature as its index.</description>
