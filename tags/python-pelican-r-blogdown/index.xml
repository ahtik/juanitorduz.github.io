      <description>Here I want to discuss my transition from pelican to blogdown and present some personal learnings. In June 2017 I decided to build a personal website/portafolio. I chose pelican, because:
 It is written in Python, which was the programing language I was mainly working on.
 I wanted to include some jupyter notebook I had already written.
 A great post: Building a data science portfolio: Making a data science blog explaining the procedure and using GitHub Pages to publist it.</description>
