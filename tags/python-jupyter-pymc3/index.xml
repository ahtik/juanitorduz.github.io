      <description>In this post I want to write about my experience as a participant (in various occasions) of the Summer School on Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods in Quantum field Theory in Villa de Leyva, Colombia.
The idea of writing this post came to me in my last visit to Villa de Leyva in May 2018.
   This picture was taken in front of Villa de Leyva&amp;rsquo;s main church.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3</title>

      <description>This post is devoted to give an introduction to Bayesian modeling using PyMC3, an open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python. Part of this material was presented in the Python Users Berlin (PUB) meet up.
   
Why PyMC3? As described in the documentation:
 PyMC3â€™s user-facing features are written in pure Python, it leverages Theano to transparently transcode models to C and compile them to machine code, thereby boosting performance.</description>
